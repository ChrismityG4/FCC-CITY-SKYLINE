# CITY SKYLINE – RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN COURSE

This is the fifth notable build on this course.  This was a very enjoyable build and an interesting learn curve.

Using linear gradients and repeating gradient to add the CSS styling to the buildings to provide windows and texture was a fun new skill to have in the tool kit.

The use of radial gradient to make the sun and moon will, I’m sure, come in handy in the future.

Using borders to create different shapes for building layers was interesting and was interesting to learn this is how it is achieved.

Thanks for reading!
